It has several map files which can be edited in the web UI, including filename for extensions to reject and whitelist for domains to whitelist.  The maps are stored in /etc/rspamd/local.d/maps.d , they are also copied from maps.orig to maps.d if not present during startup for a container with mounted volumes or new maps in a newer image.

To generate a password hash for the web interface run container then run rspamd_pw.sh and copy output into /etc/rspamd/override.d/worker-controller.inc.  Or exec rspamadm pw inside container and use result for password and enable_password.

This is then retained in the persistent volume if mounted.

It is configured to read the dkim/arc keys from redis, to manually add a key to redis instructions are on the Rspamd website [https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html#dkim-keys-in-redis](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html#dkim-keys-in-redis).

To change the configuration add changes to the /etc/rspamd/override.d directory, and mount it with a volume.

Neural is configured for low email volume.

The docker offical image for redis has an alpine variant as well which is redis:alpine

Configuration for Spamhaus [DQS](https://github.com/spamhaus/rspamd-dqs) is now added, to enable DQS:

* Check the [usage terms](https://www.spamhaus.org/organization/dnsblusage/)
* Register for a key with [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaustech.com/dqs/).
* Confirm email address, then access details will be emailed.
* Login to portal, DQS key is the "Datafeed Query Account Key" [here](https://portal.spamhaustech.com/manuals/dqs)
* Copy the key and write it to a file, then bind mount the file with docker to /etc/rspamd/rspamd-dqs/dqs-key
* If the file exists DQS is then configured.
