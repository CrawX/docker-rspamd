# docker-rspamd
Dockerfile to run [rspamd](https://rspamd.com/) as a docker container, worker-proxy is used instead of worker-normal as it spawns a new worker if there is a crash while processing.

It has two map files which can be edited in the web UI, filename for extensions to reject and whitelist for domains to whitelist.

To generate a password hash for the web interface run container then run rspamd_pw.sh and copy output into /etc/override.d/worker-controller.inc.  Or exec rspamadm pw inside container and use result for password and enable_password.

This is then retained in the persistent volume if mounted.

It is configured to read the dkim/arc keys from redis, to manually add a key to redis instructions are on the Rspamd website [https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html#dkim-keys-in-redis](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/dkim_signing.html#dkim-keys-in-redis).

To change the configuration add changes to the /etc/rspamd/override.d directory, and mount it with a volume.
